# CS400-RedTeam
## Week3 - CS400 Project One: Final App


1. Finish README file
2. If you are a Developer (front end or back end), find the interfaces and initial dummy classes that your implementation depends on. Extend these dummy classes so that they provide enough functionality that you can work with them while developing your implementation. Discuss any questions you have about those dummy objects and their expected behavior with your teammates during or shortly after your team's kickoff meeting.
3. The Integration Manager will record a demo video as sketched in the proposal. If any last integration bugs occur, the team will help the Integration Manager to fix them.
   - Videos should be between 2-3 minutes and will be shared on FlipGrid under the topic "Project One Demo".
